\subsection*{1 - Speed of Delivery, synchronization and traceability issues}

The respondents were asked the following 2 questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In your experience, how frequently does the absence of crucial information cause delays in processes such as shipping, packaging, etc.?
  \item How important is Inventory Management for the efficiency of the supply chain?
\end{enumerate}
They were also given some affirmations to classify their agreement with. 
\par\textbf{Affirmations:}
\begin{enumerate}

\item In a supply chain, if the information gap between partners is shortened, a faster product cycle (or shorter lead time) can be attained.
\item Distribution, supply, demand and inventory planning all rely heavily on the information being both accurate and up to date

\item Supply Chain Management lacks a way to quickly and seamlessly share between companies all the information generated by the flow of assets in a Supply Chain.
\end{enumerate}

The data collected from these questions and affirmations can be found in figure \ref{group3_graphics}. The data from the affirmations was also

  \subsection*{2 - Quality assurance and traceability issues}

%GRAFICOS DAS 2 PERGUNTAS DE QUALITY ASSURANCE (traceability)
1 - "Non-compliance with certain standards is a big issue that affects the reputation of companies working with sensitive products."
2 - In your experience, do you think that compliance with quality standards would be easier to achieve if all the products were traced as well as the processes they go through?


CONCLUDE: speed of delivery and synchronization really need an upgrade, as per the first 5 questions; traceability is also an issue, especially because of quality assurance, as well as because of its correlation with the speed of delivery(but not only). Security is not an issue itself, but an important aspect to always take care of, when establishing these other attributes. es
