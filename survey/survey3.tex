%GRAFICO DAS 4 PRIMEIRAS RATE THE AFFIRMATION+FREQUENCY OF DELAYS (speed of delivery, synchronization,
1 - How important is Inventory Management for the efficiency of the supply chain?
2 - "In a supply chain, if the information gap between partners is shortened, a faster product cycle (or shorter lead time) can be attained."
3 - "Distribution, supply, demand and inventory planning all rely heavily on the information being both accurate and up to date"
4 - In your experience, how frequently does the absence of crucial information cause delays in processes such as shipping, packaging, etc.?
5 - "Supply Chain Management lacks a way to quickly and seamlessly share between companies all the information generated by the flow of assets in a Supply Chain."


%GRAFICOS DAS 2 PERGUNTAS DE QUALITY ASSURANCE (traceability)
1 - "Non-compliance with certain standards is a big issue that affects the reputation of companies working with sensitive products."
2 - In your experience, do you think that compliance with quality standards would be easier to achieve if all the products were traced as well as the processes they go through?


CONCLUDE: speed of delivery and synchronization really need an upgrade, as per the first 5 questions; traceability is also an issue, especially because of quality assurance, as well as because of its correlation with the speed of delivery(but not only). Security is not an issue itself, but an important aspect to always take care of, when establishing these other attributes. es
