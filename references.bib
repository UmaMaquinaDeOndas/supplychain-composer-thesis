abstract = {To establish that a document was created after a given moment in time, it is necessary to report events that could not have been predicted before they happened. To establish that a document was created before a given moment in time, it is necessary to cause an event based on the document, which can be observed by others. Cryptographic hash functions can be used both to report events succinctly, and to cause events based on documents without revealing their contents. Haber and Stornetta have proposed two schemes for digital time-stamping which rely on these principles [HaSt 91]. We reexamine one of those protocols, addressing the resource constraint required for storage and verification of time-stamp certificates. By using trees, we show how to achieve an exponential increase in the publicity obtained for each time-stamping event, while reducing the storage and the computation required in order to validate a given certificate. We show how time-stamping can be used in certain circumstances to extend the useful lifetime of different kinds of cryptographic certifications of authenticity, in the event that the certifying protocol is compromised. This can be applied to digital signatures, or to time-stamping itself, making the digital time-stamping process renewable.},

@article{Nakamoto2008,
abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Over the last few years, it has increasingly attracted the attention of different industries. Especially in Fintech, Blockchain is hyped as the silver bullet that might overthrow today's payment handling. Slowly, the logistics and supply chain man-agement community realizes how profoundly Blockchain could affect their industry. To shed light on this emerging field, we conducted an online survey and asked logistics professionals for their opinion on use case exemplars, barriers, facilitators, and the general prospects of Blockchain in logistics and supply chain management. We found most of our participants are fairly positive about this new technology and the benefits it offers. However, factors like the hierarchical level, Blockchain experiences, and the industry sector have a significant impact on the participants' evaluation. We reason that the benefits over existing IT solutions must be carved out more carefully and use cases must be further explored to get a rather conservative industry, like logistics, more excited about Blockchain.},

Access to customer demand needs to be shared effectively, and product and service deliveries must be tracked to provide visibility in the supply chain. Business process integration is based on standards and reference architectures, which should offer end-to-end integration of product data. Companies operating in supply chains establish process and data integration through the specialized intermediate companies, whose role is to establish interoperability by mapping and integrating company-specific data for various organizations and systems. This has typically caused high integration costs, and diffusion is slow. This paper investigates the requirements and functionalities of supply chain integration. Cloud integration can be expected to offer a cost-effective business model for interoperable digital supply chains. We explain how supply chain integration through the blockchain technology can achieve disruptive transformation in digital supply chains and networks.},

The inherited characteristics of this technology enhance trust through transparency and traceability within any transaction of data, goods, and financial resources. Despite initial doubts about this technology, recently governments and large corporations have investigated to adopt and improve this technology in various domains of applications, from finance, social and legal industries to design, manufacturing and supply chain networks. In this article, the authors review the current status of this technology and some of its applications. The potential benefit of such technology in manufacturing supply chain is then discussed in this article and a vision for the future blockchain ready manufacturing supply chain is proposed. Manufacturing of cardboard boxes are used as an example to demonstrate how such technology can be used in a global supply chain network. Finally, the requirements and challenges to adopt this technology in the future manufacturing systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Since the late 1950s it has been recognized that the systems used internally within supply chains can lead to oscillations in demand and inventory as orders pass through the system. The uncertainty generated by these oscillations can result in late deliveries, order cancellations and an increased reliance on inventory to buffer these effects. Despite the best efforts of organizations to stabilize the dynamics generated, industry still experiences a high degree of uncertainty from this source. The supply chain complexity triangle describes the interaction of deterministic chaos, parallel interactions and demand amplification. It provides a framework for understanding the generation of uncertainty within supply chains. The implications for supply chain strategy and manufacturing logistics are discussed.},

abstract = {Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or "intrinsic value" and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin"), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ("smart contracts") or even blockchain-based "decentralized autonomous organizations" (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

year = {1982},
month = {July},
abstract = {I have long felt that, because it was posed as a cute problem about philosophers seated around a table, Dijkstra's dining philosopher's problem received much more attention than it deserves. (For example, it has probably received more attention in the theory community than the readers/writers problem, which illustrates the same principles and has much more practical importance.) I believed that the problem introduced in [41] was very important and deserved the attention of computer scientists. The popularity of the dining philosophers problem taught me that the best way to attract attention to a problem is to present it in terms of a story.

There is a problem in distributed computing that is sometimes called the Chinese Generals Problem, in which two generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive. I stole the idea of the generals and posed the problem in terms of a group of generals, some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision. I wanted to assign the generals a nationality that would not offend any readers. At the time, Albania was a completely closed society, and I felt it unlikely that there would be any Albanians around to object, so the original title of this paper was The Albanian Generals Problem. Jack Goldberg was smart enough to realize that there were Albanians in the world outside Albania, and Albania might not always be a black hole, so he suggested that I find another name. The obviously more appropriate Byzantine generals then occurred to me.

The main reason for writing this paper was to assign the new name to the problem. But a new paper needed new results as well. I came up with a simpler way to describe the general 3n+1-processor algorithm. (Shostak's 4-processor algorithm was subtle but easy to understand; Pease's generalization was a remarkable tour de force.) We also added a generalization to networks that were not completely connected. (I don't remember whose work that was.) I also added some discussion of practical implementation details.},

Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain in their IT systems, but scala- bility is an often-cited concern of current blockchain technology. Therefore, the goals of this preliminary performance analysis are twofold. First, a methodology for evaluating a blockchain platform is developed. Second, the analysis results are presented to inform practitioners in making decisions regarding adoption of blockchain technology in their IT systems. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios. I.},

abstract = {The blockchain technology started as the innovation that powered the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. But in recent years, leaders in finance, banking, and many more companies has given this new innovation more attention than ever before. They seek a new technology to replace their system which are often inefficient and costly to operate. However, one of the reasons why it not possible to use a blockchain right away is because of the poor performance. Public blockchains, where anyone can partici-pate, can only process a couple of transaction per second and is therefore far from usable in the world of finance. Permissioned blockchains is an-other type of blockchain where only a restricted set of users have the rights to decide what will be recorded in the blockchain. This allows permissioned blockchains to have a number of advantages over public blockchains. Most notably is the ability to split the network into seg-ments where only a subset of nodes needs to validate transactions to a particular application, allowing the use of parallel computing and better scaling. Moreover, the validating nodes can be trusted, allowing the use of consensus algorithm which offer much more throughput. In this paper, we compare public blockchain with permissioned blockchain and address the notable trade-offs: decentralization, scalability and se-curity, in the different blockchain networks. Furthermore, we examine the potential of using a permissioned blockchain to replace the old sys-tems used in financial institutes and banks by launching a Hyperledger Fabric network and run stress tests.},

abstract = {Overview. A blockchain is best understood in the model of state-machine replication [8], where a service maintains some state and clients invoke operations that transform the state and generate outputs. A blockchain emulates a " trusted " computing service through a distributed protocol, run by nodes con-nected over the Internet. The service represents or creates an asset, in which all nodes have some stake. The nodes share the common goal of running the service but do not necessarily trust each other for more. In a " permissionless " blockchain such as the one underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, anyone can operate a node and participate through spending CPU cycles and demonstrating a " proof-of-work. " On the other hand, blockchains in the " permissioned " model control who participates in validation and in the protocol; these nodes typically have established identities and form a consortium. A report of Swanson compares the two models [9]. Hyperledger. The Hyperledger Project (www.hyperledger.org) is a collaborative effort to cre-ate an enterprise-grade, open-source distributed ledger framework and code base. It aims to advance blockchain technology by identifying and realizing a cross-industry open standard platform for dis-tributed ledgers, which can transform the way business transactions are conducted globally. Established as a project of the Linux Foundation in early 2016, the Hyperledger Project currently has more than 50 members. Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric (github.com/hyperledger/fabric) is an imple-mentation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart contracts, leveraging familiar and proven technologies, with a modular architecture allowing pluggable implementations of various functions. It is one of multiple projects currently in incubation under the Hyperledger Project. A developer-preview of the Hyperledger Fabric (called " v0.5-developer-preview ") has been released in June 2016 (github.com/hyperledger/fabric/wiki/Fabric-Releases). The distributed ledger protocol of the fabric is run by peers. The fabric distinguishes between two kinds of peers: A validating peer is a node on the network responsible for running consensus,},

abstract = {With this paper, we provide a brief analysis of the most notable differences between the distributed ledger technologies (DLT) Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and Ethereum. Our intention is to give decision makers new to DLT guidance for what use cases Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Ethereum are most suitable. Three different frameworks From the white papers of Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda (in the following only referred to as Fabric and Corda, respectively) and Ethereum it becomes obvious that these frameworks have very different visions in mind with respect to possible fields of application. Development of both Fabric 1 and Corda 2 is driven by concrete use cases, whereas Corda's use cases are drawn from the financial services industry. Consequently, this is where Corda sees its main field of application. In contrast, Fabric intends to provide a modu-lar and extendable architecture that can be employed in various industries, from banking and healthcare over to supply chains. Ethereum also presents itself as utterly independent of any specific field of application. 3 However, in contrast to Fabric, it is not modularity that stands out but the provision of a generic platform for all kinds of transactions and applications. Table 1 pro-vides a summary of the three frameworks.},

@article{Yeung2009,
abstract = {Supply chain integration nowadays is considered an important approach to building and sustaining competitive advantages. Many previous empirical researches have investigated trust and power between suppliers and customers, yet, the effects of trust and coercive power on supply chain integration are still largely unknown. This study investigates trust, coercive power and their interaction and their impact on internal and supplier integration, based on data collected in Chinese supply chains. The results reveal that both trust and coercive power improve internal and supplier integration, but when trust is low, coercive power reduces internal integration. Contradictory to conventional wisdom that coercive power hinders cooperation, this study found that coercive power improves supplier integration in Chinese supply chains, with or without the presence of trust. This study provides significant insights for Chinese inter-organizational trust-power relationship management and supply chain integration practices. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

To unlock this potential, the OriginTrail protocol was designed purposefully to tackle the main challenges which limit the fluent exchange of, and integrity of data in product supply chains. With supply chain data becoming increasingly fragmented, scalability and cost concerns of current decentralized solutions become evident. OriginTrail is a unique solution allowing IT providers in supply chains to set up blockchain supported data sharing in multi-organizational environment. It helps them build transparency beyond the " one step down, one step up " traceability principle. Furthermore, it improves the integrity of product data and drives efficiencies for stakeholders. The first version of the OriginTrail solution is proven and currently deployed in the food industry. The upcoming open source version will be suitable to any product supply chain such as automotive, consumer goods, pharmaceutical etc.},
