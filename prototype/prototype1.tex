In order to make a good choice for the framework, there is a need to make a mixed analysis that focuses on the most important functionalities that an information system should feature as well as what use cases are most viable for applying blockchain to the supply chain. Some conclusions from these topics were already taken in the previous chapter. %TODO: reference the chapter instead

In addition to the requirements from the previous chapter, the performance analysis from chapter X should also be taken into account. %TODO: reference the chapter instead

\subsection{Framework Requirements Elicited from the Survey}

The requirements for the choice of a framework can be partially derived from the most important functionalities pointed out on the results of the survey.


The most important functionalities were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Interoperability between systems - though it was not pointed out to be a point of improvement, it still ranked as a highly needed functionality in information systems, which leads to the conclusion that current systems might already be interoperable up to a certain extent.
	\item Security according to the latest security requirements - relates to fraud detection
	\item Real-time tracking and sharing of information - relates to traceability
	\item Controlled access for the users - relates to fraud detection
\end{itemize}


One thing that stands out is the fact that these functionalities correlate directly to the points of focus from this thesis: \textbf{synchronization, security and tracking}.  From section 6.3.4, it was also ascerted that the improvement of information privacy in supply chains was not very important in itself. Maybe it is something that the current systems already do well, but as we can see, \textbf{there are still some outstanding concerns which deal with other security aspects that still need to be taken care of}. Traceability, access control and fraud detection seem to rank high on the requirements.

\textbf{Thus, the selected framework should support a highly controlled environment, where the actions each user takes should be properly authorized and tracked}.
