The first question, \textbf{"What is the Blockchain tool or framework most adequate to the development of an architecture that can support these requirements?"} requires an analysis of the frameworks. The second question, \textbf{"Is it possible to build a feasible architectural design, by using such a tool, to implement all these requirements?"} requires that the elicited requirements be formed into a list and that an architectural design be built and implemented using the chosen framework. Only at the end of these tasks can the results be validated. 

This chapter deals with these tasks sequentially. The first section analyzes which frameworks best satisfy the requirements and a choice is made. The second through fourth sections resemble a software engineering approach: starting in the requirements specification, following it up with the design, implementation using the framework and finally, the validation of the requirements.
